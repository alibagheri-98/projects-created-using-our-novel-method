We conducted research to explore various methodologies for designing final course projects aimed at benefiting students and demonstrating the practical applications of course concepts in real-world projects. We applied our methods to create two distinct course projects:
1- A final course project tailored for the 'Probability and Statistics for Engineering' course, which is available in the 'PS_Final_Project' folder.
2- An equally significant final course project designed for the 'Machine Learning' course, documented in the 'ML_Final_Project' folder.

These projects have been meticulously crafted to bridge the gap between theory and practicality, offering students opportunities to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. Currently, we are in the process of preparing a research paper titled 'A Novel Method for Designing Course Projects and Addressing Educational Objectives,' authored by Ali Bagheri, Soheil Moradi, and Mohammad Hossein Yassaee. This paper presents our innovative methodology and its potential impact on course design and student learning outcomes.
