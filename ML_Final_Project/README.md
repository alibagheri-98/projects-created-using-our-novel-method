# Movie-Recommender-System

This repository contains the final project for the machine learning course instructed by Dr. Amini at Sharif University of Technology. Crafted by us, a team of teaching assistants for the machine learning course under Dr. Amini's guidance, this final project represents the culmination of our efforts. I held a leadership role among the project teaching assistants. The project's creation process involved distributing distinct research papers to each teaching assistant, tasking them with formulating questions derived from their assigned papers.

## phase 1
Consists of a collection of theoretical questions aimed at imparting fundamental knowledge about recommender systems to students

## phase 2
Comprises practical questions designed to guide the creation of a movie recommender system.
